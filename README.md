以二次型形式逼近方向距离函数，通过线性规划得到方向距离函数的大概参数表达式，通过微分之比得到非合意产出的影子价格，其中使用LINGO求解线性规划
The direction distance function is approximated by quadratic form
and the approximate parameter expression of the direction distance function is obtained by linear programming.
The shadow price of undesired output is obtained by the ratio of differentiation
the linear programming is conducted by LINGO
LINGO code is updated
